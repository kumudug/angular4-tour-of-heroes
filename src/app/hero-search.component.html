           <!-- As expected, the *ngFor repeats hero objects from the component's heroes property.
           
           But as you'll soon see, the heroes property is now an Observable of hero arrays, rather than just a hero array. The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable until you route it through the async pipe (AsyncPipe). The async pipe subscribes to the Observable and produces the array of heroes to *ngFor. -->
